# Dummy's Guide to Python

## What is Python?

Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high level programming language. It is most effective in rapid application development, and is touted as being easy to learn.

## Awesome! Where can I get started?

There's a lot of resources about Python online, even on Python's own [website](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide)! But the first thing to do is download it.

You can check to see if it's installed using 
```
python --version
```
in the command line. For Linux and Mac users, this is the terminal. For Windows users, you can use Powershell or install WSL (Ubuntu).

If you don't have it installed, you can easily install it by referencing the installations below:

### Linux & Mac Installation

To install, run:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3.6
```

That's it!

### Windows 10

To install, you can download the app from the Microsoft Store.

To write a file, open the Python IDE version instead of Python (comes with the installation in the store).

## Python Language: Useful Information

### Information

1) The keyword "import" is used to import objects/classes from another file. Keyword "from" identifies the Python file (in the form of .py). You don't need to include .py. You can also import functions/classes/etc from libraries/frameworks installed.

Example:
```python
import findme from someFile # someFile is saved as someFile.py in the current directory
```

2) You can declare functions by using "def" and a colon. 

Example:
```python
def functionName(inputs):
	# how the function works
```

3) Classes are defined similar to functions.

Example
```python
class className:
	# stuff
```

When a class is actually being used, it's called an object.
